	<h3 id="theEditor"><span class="icon large" data-icon="v"></span> Customizing the Editor</h3>
	<p>If you are not interested in customizing the editor, skip to the <a href="#theForumStyles">next section</a>.</p>
	<h4>bbcode_box.css</h4>
	<p>All the styling for the editor itself is defined in bbcode_box.css which only loads for users; and only within the Private Message and Forums modules. If you desire to customize the editor to better match your theme, start by choosing a copy of bbcode_box.css which matches closest to your desired end result (See ABBC_BOXv25/extras/Editor_Themes) and copy to the style directory of your theme. </p>
	<p>It's probably easiest to start with the linear gradients that style both the toolbars, and the container the holds the main textarea. While we will not be providing step by step instructions, it's a big mess of CSS that should look something like below (occurs twice). Fairly self explanatory, the top color being #ffffff and the lower #BCCEDA, in this example. Note that you will need to define an actual background image for these as not all browsers support linear gradients (IE&lt;10 does not support). Just a tip: All that was done to create the fallback background images for the default editor themes, was to take a screenshot in a linear-gradient supported browser, and create the background images from that...</p>
	<pre>.abbctoolbars{border-bottom:1px solid #95b0b9;vertical-align:middle;
background-color: transparent;
background-image: url(../../../mods/bbcode_box/images/bg3.png); /* other browsers */
background-image: -ms-linear-gradient(top, #ffffff 0%, #BCCEDA 100%);/* IE10 */ 
background-image: -moz-linear-gradient(top, #ffffff 0%, #BCCEDA 100%);/* Mozilla Firefox */ 
background-image: -o-linear-gradient(top, #ffffff 0%, #BCCEDA 100%);/* Opera */ 
background-image: -webkit-gradient(linear, left top, left bottom, color-stop(0, #ffffff), color-stop(1, #BCCEDA ));/* Webkit (Safari/Chrome 10) */ 
background-image: -webkit-linear-gradient(top, #ffffff 0%, #BCCEDA 100%);/* Webkit (Chrome 11+) */ 
background-image: linear-gradient(top, #ffffff 0%, #BCCEDA 100%)}/* Proposed W3C Markup */ </pre>
	<p>Get past that step and the editor should be looking much better within your theme, and you can now work on getting any border colors/styles to match. Note that there is also box-shadow styling on some buttons and that might be another thing to tweak to your liking. Just search for box-shadow with the css file. Aside from that, edit and tweak away as needed, just don't remove anything unless you know what you are doing :)</p>
	<h4>Full Width Padded Textarea</h4>
	<p>To adjust the auto-expanding textarea minimum and maximum height see <code>mods/bbcode_box/js/textarea-settings.js</code>. The default minimum is 250px and maximum of 600px. Adjust as desired, just note that at some point the user would need to scroll anyway... (running out of visible space in the browser window). Remember most users viewport is not as tall as their screen resolution. </p>
	<p>If you get into altering the textarea be aware that there issues with 100% width padded textareas in some browsers, so the textarea is actually transparent and nested inside another element to simulate padding. Note that it is important to keep the <code>-webkit-appearance: none;</code> declaration as the focus styling of Chrome/Safari will expose the &quot;trickery&quot; used to accomplish this.</p>
	<h4>Custom Sprite Images</h4>
	<p>PSD files for the two sprite images which power the editor are provided for those with access to Photoshop (See ABBC_BOXv25/extras/PSD_Files). No tips other than be aware it can take awhile to create a decent sprite pack, depending on how many changes you make, so get comfortable.. Note that the sprites included with the mod are saved as high quality png24, which results in larger files sizes. Since this is only displayed to users, filesize shouldn't be much of a concern.. but you are welcome to save in whichever format suits your needs, just note that some subtle transparencies and gradients are used in the files.</p>
	<h4>Emoticons/Smilies</h4>
	<p>Smilies are initially hidden and appear in a toolbar below the main textarea. Note that <code>max-height:15px;</code> and <code>max-width:15px;</code> have been applied to the smilies so they fit correctly within the toolbar; to adjust see class <code>.abbcemos</code>. If you prefer the smilies to be displayed by default find and remove <code>#emostatus</code> from the list of elements set to <code>display:none;</code> on or around line 4 of bbcode_box.css. Also note that since the smilies toolbar is displayed at the bottom there may be times when it is outside the viewable area of the browser window. If this is the case, JavaScript is used to determine if the toolbar is in the viewable area, and if not it will use a smooth scrolling effect to scroll down to the top of the textarea. This should, for most users, bring the toolbar into view; although it may depend how much the user has typed into the expanding textarea, as well as how large the resolution of their display. </p>

	<p><span class="icon" data-icon="!"></span><strong>If you are NOT using the Code Highlighter addon, but still posting code samples</strong> it is recommended that all occurances of <code>white-space:pre-wrap</code> within <code>bbcode_addons.css</code> be changed to <code>white-space:normal</code> or code will be double spaced. Note that you may have multiple copies of <code>bbcode_addons.css</code> depending on your installation.</p>
	<h4>bbcode_addons.css</h4>
	<p>Just an overview with tips and notes regarding what some of the default classes are used for within the mod. Note that no edits are provided within the code examples, the code is only provided as a reference.</p>
	<h5>Font Types</h5>
	<p>The basic font classes were constructed to deliver the most similar font regardless of operating system or browser; but you are welcome to customize as needed.. Maybe spice up with some CSS3 text shadow effects or anything else that suits your desires..</p>
	<pre>.arialblack{font-family:'Arial Black',Gadget,sans-serif}
.centurygothic{font-family:'Century Gothic',futura,'URW Gothic L',Verdana,sans-serif}
.comicsans{font-family:'Comic Sans MS',cursive}
.couriernew{font-family:'Courier New',Courier,'Nimbus Mono L',monospace}
.georgia{font-family:Constantina,Georgia,'Nimbus Roman No9 L',serif}
.impact{font-family:Impact, Haettenschweiler, 'Arial Narrow Bold', sans-serif}
.lucidac{font-family: 'Lucida Console', Monaco, monospace}
.lucidau{font-family:'Lucida Sans Unicode','Lucida Grande','Lucida Sans','DejaVu Sans Condensed',sans-serif}
.palatino{font-family:Cambria,'Palatino Linotype','Book Antiqua','URW Palladio L',serif}
.tahoma{font-family:'Tahoma',sans-serif}
.trebuchet{font-family:'Trebuchet MS',sans-serif}
.verdana{font-family:Verdana,Geneva,'DejaVu Sans',sans-serif}</pre>
	<h5>Font Sizes</h5>
	<p>Font size selection uses seven different classes: <code>.small-caps</code> <code>.small</code> <code>.normal</code> <code>.large</code> <code>.x-large</code> <code>.smaller</code> <code>.larger</code></p>
	<p>Of which 6 classes are defined within the core ravennuke.css <code>.small-caps</code> <code>.normal</code> <code>.large</code> <code>.x-large</code> <code>.smaller</code> <code>.larger</code></p>
	<p>Although note that <code>.normal</code> does not have a set size and should be adjusted to match the default font-size of your theme. Also note that <code>.small</code> is already defined by many themes, so it has not been declared within the mod to avoid conflicts. It is highly recommended that you DO NOT edit ravennuke.css, and simple re-declare any desired CSS within the style.css of your theme.</p>
	<h5>Custom Color Swatches</h5>
	<p>Instead of using preset named colors, classes are used so that the color palette can be customized by theme. Customize as desired, just make sure the colors match for the color swatches and editor swatches; as one declares the color of text and the other the color of the editor button. As a general rule dark colors work better for light backgrounds, and pastel colors work better for dark backgrounds. If you want to get creative, there are some great swatch collections at <a href="http://kuler.adobe.com/" target="_blank">kuler.adobe.com</a> which could be used to build a custom color palette.</p>

.bg-color14{background-color:#000000}</pre>
	<h5>Video Position and Size</h5>
	<p>Video position and size are defined by CSS and can be customized on a theme by theme basis. The default settings are 420x315(default), 210x172(small), 480x360(med), and 640x480(large). Also note that by default all large videos are centered, regardless of left or right position, as most themes would not have enough room to float large videos. Adjust sizes as needed, as some themes may have more or less room depending on layout width. If you are using a fixed-width theme you may want to play with the margins a bit so videos will be nicely spaced when floating; as I did not take the time to customize themes to this degree..</p>
	<pre>/* youtube and archive audio/video settings */
.forumvideo{margin:10px 10px 10px 0} /*default video on left*/
.forumvideo.video-small-left,.forumvideo.video-medium-left,.forumvideo.video-left,.forumvideo.audio-left{float:left;margin:10px 10px 10px 0} /*left floated video*/
.forumvideo.video-small-right,.forumvideo.video-medium-right,.forumvideo.video-right,.forumvideo.audio-right{float:right;margin:0 10px 10px 10px} /*right floated video*/
.forumvideo.video-small-center,.forumvideo.video-medium-center,.forumvideo.video-center,.forumvideo.audio-center,.forumvideo.video-large-right,.forumvideo.video-large-left,.forumvideo.video-large-center,.forumvideo.video-large{margin:10px auto;text-align:center} /*by default all large videos do not flaot and are centered */
div.video iframe,div.video-left iframe,div.video-right iframe,div.video-center iframe{width:420px;height:315px} /*default size*/
div.video-small iframe,div.video-small-left iframe,div.video-small-right iframe,div.video-small-center iframe{width:210px;height:172px} /*sm size*/
div.video-medium iframe,div.video-medium-left iframe,div.video-medium-right iframe,div.video-medium-center iframe{width:480px;height:360px} /*med size*/
div.video-large iframe,div.video-large-left iframe,div.video-large-right iframe,div.video-large-center iframe{width:640px;height:480px} /*large size*/
div.audio iframe,div.audio-left iframe,div.audio-right iframe,div.audio-center iframe{width:500px;height:30px} /*audio size*/
.forumvideotagline{padding-top:6px}</pre>
	<h5>Spoiler Button and HR</h5>
	<p>To avoid conflicting with any styling a given theme may be using for <code>&lt;button&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;hr /&gt;</code>, no styling has been declared for those elements within the mod. Although both use unique classes and can be customized as desired via CSS:<br /> <code>&lt;button class="spoilbutton" type="button"&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;hr class="fobar" /&gt;</code></p>
	<h5>Preventing Hidden Content</h5>
	<p>The custom class bbcode wraps text in a span, so to prevent users from posting hidden or invisible content, adjust this line to match your theme. In most cases the text of the post will be wrapped in a <code>&lt;td class="postbody"&gt;</code> or <code>&lt;div class="postbody"&gt;</code> and no change is needed; but if your theme uses a different class adjust as needed. Not really a huge issue as search engines stopped indexing content that was set to <code>display:none;</code> and <code>visibility:hidden;</code> about 10 years ago, but probably a good idea anyway. If you want to make sure it has been done correctly use the default ravennuke.css classes to test by using <code>[class="invisible"]this should be visible[/class]</code> and <code>[class="display-none"]this should display[/class]</code> within your Advanced BBCode Box powered forums (preview of a post will work).</p>
	<pre>td.postbody span,div.postbody span{display:inline;visibility:visible} /*prevent hidden content*/</pre>

	<p>Just some quick tips and notes regarding theme specific tweaks you may want to consider. Not interested? Skip to the <a href="#theAddons">next section</a></p>
	<h5>Loading Animations</h5>
	<p>A couple of different loading animations are used within the mod, and since there is no way to define them by CSS; if you desire to customize them you must edit the template(s).</p>
	<p>An animated png (apng) is used for the twitter signature which is still not widely supported by all browsers, but works well on both light and dark backgrounds; and defaults to the first frame of animation for unsupported browsers. To replace with another image search for <code>mods/bbcode_box/images/76.png</code> (bbcode.tpl) and replace with a loading animation of your choosing.</p>
	<img src="../root/mods/bbcode_box/images/76.png" alt="sample animation"/><img style="background-color:#000000" src="../root/mods/bbcode_box/images/76.png" alt="sample animation" /> &lt;- If your browser supports apng you will see animation here
	<p>The other animation is used for loading the ajax help into the editor, and is a traditional animated gif. To replace with another image search for <code>mods/bbcode_box/images/helpload.gif</code> (posting_body.tpl, occurs multiple times) and replace with a loading animation of your choosing... Unless you want to make various CSS changes it would be a good idea to keep the same size on this loading animation as that of the default one (41x20).</p>
	<img src="../root/mods/bbcode_box/images/helpload.gif" alt="sample animation" /><img style="background-color:#000000" src="../root/mods/bbcode_box/images/helpload.gif" alt="sample animation" /> &lt;- Light/Dark support isn't as good with GIF's
	<p>Both default animations were created at <a href="http://preloaders.net/en/horizontal" target="_blank">preloaders.net/en/horizontal</a> which is a great resource if you are looking for a custom loading animation to match your theme.</p>
	
	<h5>Dynamic Twitter Sigs</h5>
	<p>Extra effort was made to keep from bombarding twitter with multiple requests for latest tweets; which results in only one request per username per page load... regardless of how many times it appears on a page, such as multiple times within forum signatures. Although to achieve this the resulting JavaScript is less than elegant, but it works in all browsers as intended. If you are JavaScript wiz have at it, as there may be more efficient methods for those more familiar with JavaScript/JSON. Just be aware it's not completely straight forward since the info has to be passed to templates, and so forth.</p>
	<p>Whatever method is used, since this is done client side try to keep under 150 requests per hour, which is the limit as of this writing; based on IP address. In the current implementation it would be difficult, but not impossible for visitors to reach this limit; depending on the number of different signatures on a page and the number of pages viewed in an hour. Due to the nature of the method used to retrieve tweets, it can be difficult to debug what exactly is going on behind the scenes.. but at times the tweets loaded so quickly I suspect they were being pulled from the browser cache; which is good news if you are concerned with irritating twitter with too many requests... Ideally some cache mechanism would be built-in, but doing so would require more time and I have other projects on the board.. Special thanks to <a href="http://www.dustindiaz.com/" target="_blank">Dustin Diaz</a> for the JavaScript used to parse tweets into clickable links.</p>
	
	<h5>Removing Certain Features</h5>
	<p>Not all features are appropriate for all sites, and ideally there would be an administration panel allowing for enabling and disabling of specific features; but that will have to wait until a future release (which may be awhile). Removing a feature has to be done manually by first removing all references to it in <code>bbcode.php</code>, then removing all references in ALL copies of <code>bbcode.tpl</code>, and finally locating and removing the button (actually an image) that adds the code in the editor <code>posting_body.tpl</code> (ALL copies). Don't worry about editing any JavaScript files as the prior three steps should be fine in itself. </p>
	
	<h5>Adding Buttons and Features</h5>
	<p>For those with a little HTML, CSS, and PHP experience, adding buttons or features isn't particularly difficult, but does require a little time, testing, and patience. Adding a button/feature will likely involve editing of these files</p>
	<p><code>bbcode.php</code> <code>bbcode.tpl</code> <code>posting_body.tpl</code> <code>bbcode_box.js</code></p>
	<p>While it is best to customize a sprite image if you are adding buttons, not everyone has access to Photoshop; so there is a method to add standard icons that can still match the editor style to some degree. Take a look at how the smilies toggle button was done in the editor for an example. You'll notice the button is actually a div that has a blank button background, with an animated gif inside... it's also the div that has toggle effects applied to it as well. Look for <code>#abbcsmiles</code> and <code>.abbcshim</code> within <code>bbcode_box.css</code>; as well as the JavaScript function <code>BBCemostatus()</code> to see how this was accomplished.</p>
	
	<pre>&lt;div class="postimage bbc-inactive" id="abbcsmiles" onclick="BBCemostatus()" onmouseover="helpline('abbcsmiles')"&gt;&lt;img class="abbcshim" src="mods/bbcode_box/images/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</pre>
	
	<h5>JavaScript and Custom Classes</h5>
	<p>Since users can now wrap text in any declared CSS class, it's worth taking a moment to overview what classes are used in your theme. 
	Note that if you have JavaScript fuctionality that is triggered with a <code>&lt;span&gt;</code> of a specific class, you may need to adjust those scripts to prevent users from doing something undesired within the Forums. In the context of a default unmodified <a class="postlink" href="http://www.ravennuke.com/" target="_blank">RavenNuke</a>&#153; site, there isn't too much annoying stuff that could be done, outside of broken colorbox links <code>[class="colorbox"]loremipsum[/class]</code> which was so minor IMO, no fix was applied. The custom classes functionality also allows site owners to build their own JavaScript forum enhancements, as desired... Just remember that the <code>[class="yourclass"][/class]</code> bbcode uses an inline element so NO block level elements can be nested within.</p>

	<h3 id="theAddons"><span class="icon large" data-icon="p"></span> Customizing Addons</h3>
	<p>This only pertains to the code highlighting addon. Not interested? Skip to the <a href="#theLang">next section</a></p>
	<h4>Code Highlighting</h4>
	<h5>Font Size and Inherited Styles</h5>
	<p>A default font and font-size was set for the <code>.codestyle</code> class that wraps all highlighted code; adjust as needed within <code>bbcode_addons.css</code>. Did not have alot of time to test different language highlighting in every default RN theme, but did notice some inherited styling. There was an issue with the <code>.title</code> class which is commonly defined within RN themes as well as the highlighter, so you'll notice a reference to <code>.codestyle .title</code> within <code>bbcode_addons.css</code> for that reason. It's possible there may be other cases where this happens, as more testing may be needed to reveal other inherited styles. If you notice text within your highlighted code that seems to be formatted strangely, this is likely why. Right-click&gt;Inspect Element in Google Chrome will show you styling associated with any element if you need to debug.</p>
	<h5>Browser Compatibility and IE8</h5>
	<p>While the highlight phpbb2 forum integration works well on the latest versions of the major browsers, you have a pick your &quot;poison&quot; scenario regarding code highlighting in Internet Explorer 8 (and likely earlier versions). We'll touch on this in a moment as a little background info is required... </p>
	<p>At least five different highlighting scripts were sampled prior to deciding on highlight, and our second choice of prettify happens to be used in this install guide. Many of these scripts would have been solid choices, except when it came to forum integration. The standard <code>[code][/code]</code> tags used within the forums are really simulated code blocks that use <code>&lt;br /&gt;</code> for line breaks, as well as replacing spaces and tabs with <code>&amp;nbsp;</code>. Highlight was unique in that it has easy support for dealing <code>&lt;br /&gt;</code> within code examples, as well as highlighting code within any type of element, and a nice variety of CSS based themes.</p> 
	
	<p>After installation of this mod, all code posted in the forums will use <code>&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;</code> which browsers will handle differently than the previous simulated code blocks. New code uses <code>white-space:pre-wrap</code> where old code essentially used <code>white-space:normal</code>. Ideally you would not have <code>&lt;br /&gt;</code> inter-mixed within <code>&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;</code> as line breaks should be enough with the proper css... but the Highlight script compensates well for this with one exception; IE8</p>
	
	<p>Tried a variety of work-arounds for IE8, but basically you are stuck with a decision on how you want to address a relatively minor IE8 issue. This decision comes in the form of a setting in <code>includes/addons/head-abbcbox.php</code></p>
	<pre>$IE8HighlightFix   = false;</pre>	
	<p>If this setting is <code>false</code> code will be double-spaced, yet retains code indentation. If <code>true</code> code will be single-spaced, although any code indentation is lost. Note that setting this to <code>true</code> adds a conditional comment for IE&lt;9 which loads a css file. This changes code samples from <code>white-space:pre-wrap</code> back to <code>white-space:normal</code> for IE&lt;9.</p>
	<p>Also note that there is another setting in <code>includes/addons/head-abbcbox.php</code> which is an array of modules to apply the IE8 fix to. Which means you can use the IE8 fix for the Forums and Private Message areas, without affecting other modules you may choose to use Highlight in. The fix is only needed if <code>&lt;br /&gt;</code> is inter-mixed within the code samples... See <a href="#otherMods">highlighting other modules</a> below</p>
	<h5>Additional Language Types</h5>
	<p>If you need code highlight support for more languages than is offered in the default installation, visit <a href="http://softwaremaniacs.org/soft/highlight/en/download/" target="_blank">softwaremaniacs.org/soft/highlight/en/download/</a> to download a custom package; and upload the highlight files to <code>yoursite.com/includes/jquery/</code>. Note that you will need to edit all copies of <code>posting_body.tpl</code> to add the new languages as selections within the editor. You'll be looking for a section of code like this, and the option value should match the highlighting class. See <a href="../extras/Highlighter/highlight-docs/classref.txt" target="_blank">ABBC_BOXv25/extras/Highlighter/highlight-docs/classref.txt</a> for the list of official classes.</p>
	<pre>&lt;div class="box-select"&gt;&lt;select id="codetypes" name="codetypes" onchange="codehelpline()"&gt;
&lt;optgroup label="Common Languages"&gt;
&lt;option value="code" selected="selected"&gt;generic&lt;/option&gt;
&lt;option value="apache"&gt;apache&lt;/option&gt;
&lt;option value="css"&gt;css&lt;/option&gt;
&lt;option value="html"&gt;html&lt;/option&gt;
&lt;option value="javascript"&gt;javascript&lt;/option&gt;
&lt;option value="php"&gt;php&lt;/option&gt;
&lt;option value="sql"&gt;sql&lt;/option&gt;
&lt;option value="xml"&gt;xml&lt;/option&gt;
&lt;/optgroup&gt;
&lt;optgroup label="Additional Languages"&gt;
&lt;option value="bash"&gt;bash&lt;/option&gt;
&lt;option value="cs"&gt;c#&lt;/option&gt;
&lt;option value="cpp"&gt;c++&lt;/option&gt;
&lt;option value="diff"&gt;diff&lt;/option&gt;
&lt;option value="ini"&gt;ini&lt;/option&gt;
&lt;option value="java"&gt;java&lt;/option&gt;
&lt;option value="perl"&gt;perl&lt;/option&gt;
&lt;option value="python"&gt;python&lt;/option&gt;
&lt;option value="ruby"&gt;ruby&lt;/option&gt;
&lt;/optgroup&gt;
&lt;/select&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</pre>
	<p>One other note about adding additional languages, is that new languages are being added to highlight.js over time, and to use one of these new languages will also require editing of bbcode.php. You'll be looking to add your new classes to the match pattern of language classes, which occurs twice.</p>

	<h5 id="otherMods">Highlighting Other Modules</h5>
	<p>If you need code highlighting in additional modules edit <code>yoursite.com/includes/addons/head-abbcbox.php</code> adding Your_Module to the array of modules to use the code highlighter in.</p>
	<pre>$use_highlighter   = array('Forums','Private_Messages'); // array of modules to use the code highlighter in</pre>
	<p>As long as your code is wrapped in <code>&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;</code> no additional changes should be required. Note that from previous experience the FCKeditor did not handle <code>&lt;code&gt;&lt;/code&gt;</code> tags well, so some adjustments to the $AllowableHTML array may be needed to use the FCKeditor for posting code.</p>
	<p>Another work around is to post code in the FCKeditor using only <code>&lt;pre&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;</code> tags, which requires you to edit the highlighting CSS to highlight <code>pre{}</code> as well as <code>pre code{}</code>. It would also require edits to the &quot;launcher&quot;, <a href="#theLauncher">see below</a></p>
	<p>As html can be used within <code>&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;</code> (inline elements only) don't forget to encode <code>&amp; &lt; &gt;</code> to <code>&amp;amp; &amp;lt; &amp;gt;</code> prior to posting code.</p>
	<p id="theLauncher">One other important note regarding the &quot;launcher&quot; for the highlighting script, <code>start-highlight-forums.js</code> which has a couple of settings that can be passed to the highlighter. </p>
	<pre>$(document).ready(function() {
	$("pre code").each(function(i, e) {hljs.highlightBlock(e, "  ", true)});
});</pre>
	<p>Which to highlight all <code>&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;</code> within the page.</p>
	<p>The important settings you pass to the highlighting script <code>(e, "  ", true)</code> being <code>"  "</code> which is what you replace tab with (2 spaces in this case) and <code>true</code> which tells the highlighting script how to deal with <code>&lt;br /&gt;</code>... This is important in the context of the forums, as otherwise all code would be double spaced. For more info see:  <a href="http://softwaremaniacs.org/soft/highlight/en/description/" target="_blank">softwaremaniacs.org/soft/highlight/en/description/</a></p>
	<p>Note you can also use a span of your choosing for tab replacement if you want some type of styled indentation to your code samples <br/><code>(e, '&lt;span class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;\t&lt;/span&gt;', true)</code>, which is also discussed at: <a href="http://softwaremaniacs.org/soft/highlight/en/description/" target="_blank">softwaremaniacs.org/soft/highlight/en/description/</a></p>

	<h3 id="theLang"><span class="icon large" data-icon="p"></span> Language/Translations</h3>
	<p>This only pertains to adding additional language translations to the ABBC Mod.. Not interested? Skip to the <a href="#theLegal">next section</a></p>

	<p>Only a few of the language translations actually reside within the language files uploaded (or edited/uploaded) during <a href="install.html">step one</a> of installation. The majority of translation that would need to be done is within a JavaScript file, which IS defined within the language files. You would need to create another copy of <code>mods/bbcode_box/js/bbcode_box.js</code> renaming to (for example) <code>mods/bbcode_box/js/bbcode_box_example.js</code> an then change the reference within the desired language file</p>
	<h5>EXAMPLE find</h5>
	<pre>$lang['BBcode_box_JS'] = 'mods/bbcode_box/js/bbcode_box.js';</pre>
	<h5>EXAMPLE replace</h5>
	<pre>$lang['BBcode_box_JS'] = 'mods/bbcode_box/js/bbcode_box_example.js';</pre>
	<p>Of course, at this point you would also need to go through the newly created <code>bbcode_box_example.js</code> and perform the actual translations; noting that language is embedded throughout the file. Difficulty will depend on your comfort level in working with JavaScript, and possibly which characters your language uses.</p>
